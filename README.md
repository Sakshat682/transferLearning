# Transfer Learning
## Image Classification
1. Tomato Plant diseases detection using classification of leaf images
2. Used Inception V3 for training
3. Pre-trained weights are of imagenet dataset
4. Download dataset from here -> [Tomato Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/noulam/tomato)
## To Use the notebook
1. First Load this dataset(only train and valid folders) in your drive in a folder name Datasets
2. Then add this notebook in your google colab environment
3. Go to Runtime> Change runtime type> Change the runtime environment to GPU
4. Then run all the cells
5. Model fitting will take a lot time so don't worry
6. Hurrah!! your model is trained and validated with an accuracy of around 90.0
